You will log into your repl.it account, fork your lab 1 Repl.it to create a Repl.it for lab two. Copy index and rename it lab 1. Create a new page for lab 2. Then you will write code to turn index.html into the main page of a labs portfolio. Add navigation hyperlinks so the user can surf to all lab pages and back to index. The navigation should be on every page. Put the instructions for lab 1 on the lab 1 page along with your code for lab 1. Put the instructions for lab 2 on the lab 2 page. Remember all text needs to be in a tag. On the index page add some text saying welcome to your CPSC 2125 Labs 1-6 portfolio. You will fork and add to this for labs 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

To submit your work, get the shareable link (use the invite button to generate a join link) and paste it into the submission box in CougarView.

Grading checklist:

corrections to previous labs
index page that is the welcome page for your CPSC 2125 labs 1-6 portfolio
lab 1 page has HTML you wrote for lab 1 and the lab 1 instructions
lab 2 page has instructions for lab 2
All three pages have a navigation bar (list of navigation links) that lets you get to the other two pages
All text is contained in a tag (no stray text), all tags are closed; remember the DOM!

Don't copy pasta!!! If you get code from somewhere you must include comments about where it came from, how it works, and any modifications you made!!!
You must understand all the code you turn in! It is plagiarism (academic dishonesty) to use code written by other people without proper attribution. If you use ANY code you find on the internet you MUST include a comment where it came from. You MUST understand how it works and how to modify it. You must explain in the comment how it works and any changes you made. Failure to do so will result in a 0 on the assignment and may result in an academic misconduct report. </pre></p>
