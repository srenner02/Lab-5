Add a lab3.html page to the project and add the instructions. Add a Lab 3 hyperlink to the index page and all other pages. Add semantic tags to each page in your site. Use at least header, nav, main, and footer. Recall that those don't change the look of the resulting page, they only divide your page into logical chunks. ioT devices could now understand your page layout.

Add an images folder to your site. Drag & Drop a header banner or logo image to this folder. Careful with copyright infringement! Please use resources from the Creative Commons or something you create yourself. You can also add your image from lab 1. Add this logo to all pages. 

Use the existing style sheet / CSS file: add a style for the body tag. Add a font color and a background color (there is a trick, watch the video). Also go out to w3Schools CSS page to get inspired. Run your pages to see the result.

Turn in your repl.it link. 

Grading checklist:

corrections to previous labs
lab 3 page added and link to it added to nav list on all other pages
Semantic tags added to ALL pages (minimum of header, nav, main, footer) (All your content should be organized under one of these tags.) 
Images folder with a banner image (logo) and the image from lab 1 (don't violate copyright!)
Add banner image (logo) to all pages
CSS file has style for the body tag, a font color and a background color
All text in HTML enclosed in tags. Both HTML and CSS files are organized and easy to read. Use comments!

Don't copy pasta!!! If you get code from somewhere you must include comments about where it came from, how it works, and any modifications you made!!!
You must understand all the code you turn in! It is plagiarism (academic dishonesty) to use code written by other people without proper attribution. If you use ANY code you find on the internet you MUST include a comment where it came from. You MUST understand how it works and how to modify it. You must explain in the comment how it works and any changes you made. Failure to do so will result in a 0 on the assignment and may result in an academic misconduct report.  </pre></p>
